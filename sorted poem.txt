RHYNESORTED POEM

///
 







 And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
And strength by limping sway disabled,
And mained virtue rudely strumpeted,
I have no precious time at all to spend,
Being your slave, what should I do but tend
Tired with all these, from these would I be gone
Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.
Upon the hours and times of your desire?
Nor services to do till you require.
Save where you are how happy you make those.
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,
And captive good attending captain ill:
Though you do any thing he thinks no ill.
So true a fool is love that in your will
As, to behold desert a beggar born,
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
When you have bid your servant once adieu.
Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,
Tired with all these, for restful death I cry;
And simple truth miscalled simplicity,
And needy nothing trimmed in jolity,
And art made tongue-tied by authority,
