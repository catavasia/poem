Being your slave, what should I do but tend
Upon the hours and times of your desire?
I have no precious time at all to spend,
Nor services to do till you require.
///

Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour
Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
When you have bid your servant once adieu.
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
Save where you are how happy you make those.


So true a fool is love that in your will
Though you do any thing he thinks no ill.
 

Tired with all these, for restful death I cry;
As, to behold desert a beggar born,
And needy nothing trimmed in jolity,
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,

 And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,
And mained virtue rudely strumpeted,
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
And strength by limping sway disabled,

And art made tongue-tied by authority,
And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,
And simple truth miscalled simplicity,
And captive good attending captain ill:

Tired with all these, from these would I be gone
Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.
